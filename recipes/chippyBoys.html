    <p>Simply put because they're simply made, Chippy Boys are potato chips that have been toasted and mixed with cheese and balsamic glaze.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Plain</li>
        <li>ettle-cooked potato chips</li>
        <li>Gorgonzola</li>
        <li>store-bought balsamic glaze</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>spread however many chips you'd like on a parchment-lined sheet tray and top with the crumbled cheese of your choice</li>
        <li>Then broil or toast them in the oven or toaster oven until they're golden brown</li>
        <li>You may also want to pull them out halfway through toasting and mix them around if you have a lot on the tray to ensure the ones on the top and bottom toast evenly.</li>
        <li>When they're toasted to your desired doneness, pull them out and drizzle with balsamic glaze.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer them to a bowl and toss to coat.</li>
